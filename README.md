## Project: Identify Customer Segments with Arvato
### Project Overview

In this project, I work with real-life data, which concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. I use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then I use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.9** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (>= 1.20.3)

### Running Instructions

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
